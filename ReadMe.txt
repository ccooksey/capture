Main source files for the VideoGlide Capture app from the commercial product "VideoGlide" by EchoFX, Inc. (www.echofx.com).

This was a very small piece of a much larger project that included USB drivers, kernel extensions and support apps that allowed movies to be captured from various USB hardware devices. It is built using the Open PowerPlant framework, and is based on QuickTime. It is a 32-bit Carbon app developed using Xcode 2.5.3 in Mac OS 10.4. It requires a VM to even build. Due to the absence of QuickTime and Carbon on modern Macs, it will never work again.

It is here strictly as sample code. Note that my coding style has evolved significantly since this was written. I do not use hungarian notation, K&R indentation, or tabs anymore.

All code in VideoGlide, drivers, kexts, applications, installers (except for Open PowerPlant) was written exclusively by Chris Cooksey.
